# Traders: Check Sheet

Here is a quick reference of things to look for when deciding whether or not to trade on a market, to avoid getting tricked or scammed:

- Will the answer to the market question be known before the market end date/time?
- Have I checked what the resolution source is? Will it work for this kind of market?
- Is the market question objective and unambiguous?
- Does the price action, trade history, or order book(s) seem unusual?
- Am I ok with the fees?
- Could the market be interpreted in more than one way?
- Will the market question only have one answer in the end?
- Does any of the information provided in the market conflict with other parts of the market?
- Have I considered all possible edge cases with the market?
- Does the time of day matter? If so, does the market specify a timezone?
- Will reporters in the future be able to verify the answer using the resolution source provided?

Pay particular attention to the end time of the market, and what the market is actually asking. If a timezone was not provided in the market question, reporters have been assuming UTC as a (sort-of) [schelling point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)).

You can also ask the Augur community about a particular market if you are unsure. People will gladly flag potentially Invalid markets in the [Augur Discord](https://discord.gg/faud6Fx) and [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/Augur).
