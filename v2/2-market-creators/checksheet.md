# Market Creators: Check Sheet

Here’s a quick list of questions you should ask yourself before you hit that final submit button to send the transaction to create your market:

- Is my market question objective and unambiguous?
- Will my market question only have one answer?
- Will the answer to my market question be known before the market end date/time?
- Does any of the information provided in my market conflict with other parts of the market?
- Have I considered all possible edge cases with my market?
- Have I added details about the intent of the market?
- Does the time of day matter? If so, have I specified a timezone for my market?
- Will reporters in the future be able to verify the answer using the resolution source provided?
- Does the resolution source only show a snapshot of what you are trying to measure, or does it keep the history available?
- Will people from all over the world be reasonably able to understand the market question?
- Could I add more information to help traders and reporters understand the intent of my market?
- Do I have enough ETH and REP available to post the required bonds?
- Will I be adding liquidity to this market, and what is my market making strategy?
- Will I be available to be the designated reporter during the 3-day initial report window after the market end date?
- For categorical markets: Have I included all possibilities as answers? Sometimes an "Other" outcome is handy to catch edge cases.
- For scalar/numerical range markets: Have I included rounding rules in the additional details, just in case the reported answer does not match the precision of the market?

These questions should help prevent yourself from creating an invalid market or other “gotchas”.
