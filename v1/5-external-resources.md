A participation token calculator for REP holders that want to collect reporting fees. There is a lot of information about the current and next fee window.

<https://predictions.market> <br />
A community hosted Augur node provided by the folks at Guesser. An Augur node is a database that can be queried much more quickly for Augur related information when compared to querying an Ethereum node directly.
