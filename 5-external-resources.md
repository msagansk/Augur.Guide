### Explorers:

<https://exploreaugur.com/> <br />
A very simplistic read-only UI that allows you to browse markets. However, it has some very unique features that are very useful. For example, you can browse the order book of a market and see which addresses hold the most amount of SHARES of the various outcomes. 

<https://www.logfile.info/eventlogs.php?dapp=augur> <br />
A generic event log browser for Ethereum, with some Augur specific functions.

### Calculators/Other Services

<https://augur.casino/> <br />
A hosted implementation of the Augur reference UI. Requires trusting that the host is providing legitimate information, as compared to running the Augur UI yourself.

<https://reporters.chat/> <br />
A fantastic tool for reporters. It allows you to comment on specific markets and discuss how it should resolve. You can also see the dispute history of a market and also provide information why you staked on a certain outcome. A few charts are also provided.

<http://dispute.tools/#/> <br />
A dispute crowdsourcer. Allows for reporters to pool together funds for a dispute before it is active in a fee window. This can be helpful for markets where there is competition to fill a dispute bond. Helps prevent gas wars, and allows for regular reporters who don't know how to program their own dispute bots to get a chance to dispute as well. Note that the author has since disappeared since creating this tool, so it is no longer being updated and the code has never been audited. Documentation can be found here: <https://github.com/burdakovd/augur-dispute-crowdsourcer>

<http://www.pdotindex.com/> <br />
Pdot Index uses decentralized prediction markets to track the success of celebrities and public figures.

<https://www.augur.host/> <br />
Another hosted version of the Augur UI, but does not provide and Augur node for data.

<http://www.augur.today/> <br />
Provides a warp sync file to allows anyone to sync their Augur App much more quickly.

<https://musing-jennings-d2c811.netlify.com/> <br />
A breakeven share price calculator, where you estimate how likely a market will resolve Invalid, which affects the odds.

<https://blacktemplar.github.io/augur-fee-windows-info/> <br />
A participation token calculator for REP holders that want to collect reporting fees. There is a lot of information about the current and next fee window. But the most useful part is that it does some math for you to see how much REP you need to stake in order to get enough ETH to make a profit, taking gas fees into account.

<https://predictions.market> <br />
A community hosted Augur node provided by the folks at Guesser. An Augur node is a database that can be queried much more quickly for Augur related information when compared to querying an Ethereum node directly.
