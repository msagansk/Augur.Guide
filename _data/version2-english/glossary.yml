All Theoretical REP: |-
  The maximum possible total supply for a certain version of  <a href="#Reputation_Token">REP</a>. This is the sum of REP existing in a particular <a href="#Universe">universe</a> and any REP that is eligible for migration into that universe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Depending on the situation, there are two ways to calculate the value:
  <ol>
    <li>If no <a href="#Fork" >fork</a> has occurred in the universe or a fork has started but not completed, then the theoretic REP supply in the universe is the sum of the REP in that Universe and the theoretic REP supply in the previous Augur version (since REP can migrate to from a previous version to the next version at any time prior to a fork). For Augur v2, this totals to 11,000,000 REP minus any that has been burned during v2 <a href="#Dispute">disputes</a>.</li>
    <li>If a fork has occurred and the <a href="#Forking_Period">forking period</a> has ended, then the theoretic REP supply in the universe is just the amount of REP in that universe (since neither REP in the <a href="#Parent_Universe">parent universe</a> nor REP in previous versions can be migrated after a fork completes).</li>
  </ol>
  This value is used to calculate the <a href="#Forking_Threshold">forking threshold</a>.

Child Universe: |-
  A child universe is a <a href="#Universe">universe</a> spawned by its <a href="#Parent_Universe">parent universe</a> when a market in the parent universe <a href="#Fork">forks</a>.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a child universe, the <a href="#Forking_Market">forking market</a> is <a href="#Finalized_Market">finalized</a> as the <a href="#Outcome">outcome</a> that aligns with that particular child universe.
  For example, a <a href="#Market">market</a> has 3 possible outcomes: <code>Yes</code>, <code>No</code>, and <code>Invalid</code>.
  When the market forks, 3 new universes are created: <code>universe Yes</code>, <code>universe No</code>, and <code>universe Invalid</code>.
  In each universe, its corresponding outcome becomes the <a href="#Final_Outcome">final outcome</a>, such as in the <code>universe Yes</code> the final outcome of the forking market is <code>Yes</code>, in the <code>universe No</code> the final outcome of the forking market is <code>No</code>.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strictly speaking, child universes are not created at the same time as a market forks.
  It is created when <a href="#Reputation_Token">REP</a> holder first migrates their REP to it after a fork starts.
  Therefore the REP holder who first migrates their REP has to pay not only the <a href="#Transaction_Fee">transaction fee</a> of migrating their REP, but also the transaction fee of creating the child universe.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a child universe, there are no restrictions right after it is created.
  Users can do anything such as creating markets, trading <a href="#Share">shares</a>, <a href="#Report">reporting</a>, and purchasing <a href="#Participation_Token">participation tokens</a>.

Locked Universe: |-
  A locked universe is the <a href="#Parent_Universe">parent universe</a> after a <a href="#Fork">fork</a> starts.
  A universe has some restrictions imposed on it after a fork starts in it.
  Users cannot create new <a href="#Market">markets</a> and cannot stake their <a href="#Reputation_Token">REP</a> on any markets, and no more markets can <a href="#Finalized_Market">finalize</a>.

Losing Universe: |-
  A kind of <a href="#Child_Universe">child universe</a>.
  The child universe that receives the most migrated <a href="#Reputation_Token">REP</a> from the <a href="#Parent_Universe">parent universe</a> by the end of a <a href="#Fork">fork</a> becomes the <a href="#Winning_Universe">winning universe</a>, the other child universes become the <a href="#Losing_Universe">losing universe</a>.
  <br>
  <br>
  <a href="#Non-Forking_Market">Non-forking markets</a> in the parent universe cannot be migrated to losing universes, they can be migrated only to the winning universe.
  Losing universes receive only two things from the parent universe: One is the <a href="#Forking_Market">forking market</a> that is duplicated from the parent universe and <a href="#Finalized_Market">finalized</a> as the <a href="#Outcome">outcome</a> that aligns with the losing universe.
  The other is REP whose holders believe the outcome that aligns with the losing universe is true.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the system is working correctly, and people are behaving economically rationally (profit motivated), the expectation is that the losing universes will align with the <a href="#Lying_Universe">lying universes</a>.
  REP in the losing universe is expected to lose its value, since future traders wonâ€™t want to trade in a <a href="#Universe">universe</a> where <a href="#Reporter">reporters</a> have a history of lying which means REP in that universe will not receive a meaningful amount of <a href="#Trading_Fee">trading fees</a>. 
Lying Universee: |-
  A <a href="#Universe">universe</a> that has the <a href="#Forked_Market">forked market</a> whose <a href="#Final_Outcome">final outcome</a> does not correspond to objective reality.
  When the system is working correctly, and people are behaving economically rationally (profit motivated), the expectation is that the <a href="#Losing_Universe">losing universes</a> will align with the lying universes, but that is not necessarily.

Parent Universe: |-
  A parent universe is a <a href="#Universe">universe</a> that has spawned <a href="#Child_Universe">child universes</a> because a <a href="#Fork">fork</a> had occurred in the parent universe.
  <br>
  <br>
  For 60 days after a fork starts (the 60 days is called <a href="#Forking_Period">forking period</a>), <a href="#Reputation_Token">REP</a> in the parent universe can be migrated to a child universe. But after the forking period, you cannot migrate your REP to any child universe.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a fork starts, the parent universe is <a href="#Locked_Universe">locked</a> because there are some restrictions.
  Users cannot create new <a href="#Market">markets</a> and cannot stake their REP on any markets, since REP in the parent universe must be migrated to one of the child universes during the forking period.
  Therefore no more markets can <a href="#Finalized_Market">finalize</a> in the parent universe after a fork starts.
  <br>
  Users can trade and <a href="#Settlement">settle</a> their <a href="#Share">shares</a> on markets, and redeem <a href="#Participation_Token">participation tokens</a> in the parent universe even after a fork starts.

Sibling Universe: |-
  A <a href="#Child_Universe">universe</a> that shares a <a href="#Parent_Universe">parent</a> with the universe in question.
  Sibling universes are entirely disjoint.
  For example, <a href="#Reputation_Token">REP</a> can be used to stake on <a href="#Outcome">outcomes</a> only for <a href="#Market">markets</a> that exist in the same <a href="#Universe">universe</a> as the REP.
  It cannot be used in another universe.
  Also, during the <a href="#Forking_Period">forking period</a>, REP holders can migrate their REP from the parent universe to a child universe, but they cannot migrate from one sibling universe to another.

Truth Universe: |-
  A <a href="#Universe">universe</a> that has the forked market whose <a href="#Final_Outcome">final outcome</a> corresponds to objective reality.
  When the system is working correctly, and people are behaving economically rationally (profit motivated), the expectation is that the <a href="#Winning_Universe">winning universes</a> will align with the truth universes, but that is not necessarily.
  For any reason, the lying universes become the winning universes.

Universe: |-
  A universe acts like a container for the objects (such as <a href="#Reputation_Token">REP</a>, <a href="#Market">markets</a>, <a href="#Share">shares</a>, <a href="#Settlement_Fee">settlement fees</a>, and <a href="#Participation_Token">participation tokens</a>) required for Auger to work.
  All of the objects belong to a universe.
  The objects can be used only for the objects that exist in the same universe.
  For example, REP can be used to stake on outcomes only for markets that exist in the same universe as the REP, it cannot be used in another universe.
  Similarly, collected fees in the <a href="#Reporting_Fee_Pool">reporting fee pool</a> are distributed to the owners of  participation tokens that exist in the same universe as the pool.
  <br>
  When a market <a href="#Fork">forked</a>, new universes are created from the universe where the <a href="#Forking_Market">forking market</a> exists.
  The universe where the forking market exists is called <a href="#Parent_Universe">parent universe</a>, and created universes are called <a href="#Child_Universe">child universes</a>. When a fork starts, the parent universe is <a href="#Locked_Universe">locked</a> permanently.
  <br>
  Besides, a new universe is created when Augur's <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#smart-contract"  target="_blank">smart-contracts</a> are updated.
  When Augur launched on <a href="https://ethereum.org/ja/glossary/#mainnet" target="_blank">Ethereum Mainnet</a>, it had only one universe called <a href="#Genesis_Universe">genesis universe</a>, the version of this release is known as <a href="#Augur_v1">Augur v1</a>. After that, the smart-contracts were updated and a new universe was created, the version of this release is known as <a href="#Augur_v2">Augur v2</a>.

  A kind of <a href="#Child_Universe">child universe</a>.
  The child universe that receives the most migrated <a href="#Reputation_Token">REP</a> from the <a href="#Parent_Universe">parent universe</a> by the end of a <a href="#Fork">fork</a> becomes the winning universe, the other child universes become the <a href="#Losing_Universe">losing universe</a>.
  <br>
  <br>
  All markets in the parent universe can only be migrated to the winning universe and the objects attached to the <a href="#Forking_Market">forking market</a>, such as <a href="#Share">shares</a>, <a href="#Open_Interest">open interest</a>, unfilled orders, are also only migrated to the winning universe.
  (See <a href="/version2-english/9-fork/4-migration-of-the-objects.html" target="_blank">migration of the objects</a> for details.)
