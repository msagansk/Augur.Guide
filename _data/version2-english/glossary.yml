All Theoretical REP: |-
  The maximum possible total supply for a certain version of  <a href="#Reputation_Token">REP</a>. This is the sum of REP existing in a particular <a href="#Universe">universe</a> and any REP that is eligible for migration into that universe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Depending on the situation, there are two ways to calculate the value:
  <ol>
    <li>If no <a href="#Fork" >fork</a> has occurred in the universe or a fork has started but not completed, then the theoretic REP supply in the universe is the sum of the REP in that Universe and the theoretic REP supply in the previous Augur version (since REP can migrate to from a previous version to the next version at any time prior to a fork). For Augur v2, this totals to 11,000,000 REP minus any that has been burned during v2 <a href="#Dispute">disputes</a>.</li>
    <li>If a fork has occurred and the <a href="#Forking_Period">forking period</a> has ended, then the theoretic REP supply in the universe is just the amount of REP in that universe (since neither REP in the <a href="#Parent_Universe">parent universe</a> nor REP in previous versions can be migrated after a fork completes).</li>
  </ol>
  This value is used to calculate the <a href="#Forking_Threshold">forking threshold</a>.
Child Universe: |-
  A child universe is a  <a href="#Universe">universe</a> spawned by its <a href="#Parent_Universe">parent universe</a> when a market in the parent universe <a href="#Fork">forks</a>.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a child universe, the <a href="#Forking_Market">forking market</a> is <a href="#Finalized_Market">finalized</a> as the <a href="#Outcome">outcome</a> that aligns with that particular child universe. For example, a <a href="#Market">market</a> has 3 possible outcomes: <code>Yes</code>, <code>No</code>, and <code>Invalid</code>. When the market forks, 3 new universes are created: <code>universe Yes</code>, <code>universe No</code>, and <code>universe Invalid</code>. In each universe, its corresponding outcome becomes the <a href="#Final_Outcome">final outcome</a>, such as in the <code>universe Yes</code> the final outcome of the forking market is <code>Yes</code>, in the <code>universe No</code> the final outcome of the forking market is <code>No</code>.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strictly speaking, child universes are not created at the same time as a market forks. It is created when <a href="#Reputation_Token">REP</a> holder first migrates their REP to it after a fork starts. Therefore the REP holder who first migrates their REP has to pay not only the <a href="#Transaction_Fee">transaction fee</a> of migrating their REP, but also the transaction fee of creating the child universe.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a child universe, there are no restrictions right after it is created. Users can do anything such as creating markets, trading <a href="#Share">shares</a>, <a href="#Report">reporting</a>, and purchasing <a href="#Participation_Token">participation tokens</a>.
